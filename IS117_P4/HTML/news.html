            <h2>At the Nuggets-Clippers game, Russell Westbrook talks about a verbal altercation with a spectator.</h2>
            <p>Late in the Los Angeles Clippers' Monday night loss to the Denver Nuggets, Russell Westbrook got into a heated argument with a spectator.

                In the last thirty seconds of the game, referee Lauren Holtkamp approached and moved to stand between Westbrook and the seats. As two security guards entered the court, former Clipper DeAndre Jordan seemed to urge an irate Westbrook to leave the scene.
                
                At Crypto.com Arena, the male fan was seated in the row behind the courtside seats. He yelled at Westbrook and gestured with his fingers at his head.</p>
            <p>“I’m not going to speak on it because it’s not appropriate,” Westbrook said when asked what the fan shouted at him.

                “It’s unfortunate today fans can say whatever they want,” he said. “I’m just protecting myself. Personally, I won’t allow it. I won’t stand for it.”</p>
